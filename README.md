# Hotel-Reservation-System
This C program is a Hotel Reservation System that allows users to book rooms by providing details like name, check-in/check-out dates, number of people, rooms, and stay duration. It calculates the total cost using a fixed room rate, generates a random booking ID, and displays a receipt. The menu allows users to book a room or exit.
